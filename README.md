# distributed-training-coding-everything

We use the python, pytorch, pytorch.distributed to implement the famous LLM-distributed-training-methods.


## Introduce

We will try our best to coding everything to implement the distribued model training in deep learning. 

Althouth we use PyTorch, we will try to avoid using encapsulated advanced features as much as possible, such as automatic differentiation, optimizers, gradient updates, etc.
